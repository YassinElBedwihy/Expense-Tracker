the delete button system looks like:

-assign each row an id of its row number
-each time update table is ran increment all the other row numbers by 1
-each time delete button is pressed decrement all the row numbers greater than the row that got deleted by one

you can review these parts in the js code in the updatetable function and input event listener.
